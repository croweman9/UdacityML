## Projects completed as part of Udacity Machine Learning Engineer NanoDegree

## Supervised Models  
#### Regression Analysis  
Boston Housing Prices: Predicting housing prices based on factors such as size of house, neighborhood poverty levels, Student-teacher ratio of nearby schools, etc.  
#### Classification Models  
Finding Donors to Donate: Predicting people's income levels based on factors such as occupation, education level, age, etc., and estimating a best donation amount to request from each for a non-profit  
#### Neural Networks  
Building a Dog Breed Image Classifier that also detects humans in a picture  

## Unsupervised Models  
#### Clustering  
Customer Segments - Who to advertise different shows to on Netflix, by grouping what they have watched into clusters of similarity across all users 
#### Reinforcement Learning  
Quadcopter - Teach a drone to learn to fly itself, through  simulations in an environment that it learns from
  
## Final Project  
#### Personal Project Choice
Lower Back Pain classification in Medical Practice - Includes R + Python code - Final Report does not include the a-priori analysis that I have included within my R-code
